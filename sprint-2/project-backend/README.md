## Credentials Setup

In the [controllers](./controllers) directory create a file named `credentials.js` and add the following code:

```json
{
    "clientId": "your-client-id",
    "clientSecret": "your-client-secret"
}
```

Replace the `your-client-id` and `your-client-secret` with your own credentials.
